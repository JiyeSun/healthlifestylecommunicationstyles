- **Protein- and fiber-rich breakfasts** reduce cortisol-driven hunger and blunt sugar spikes.
- **Balanced macronutrients at lunch and dinner** maintain satiety and prevent post-meal fatigue.
- **Avoiding late-night food** improves sleep quality and enhances fat oxidation during rest.
- **Daily movement**, even short bouts, stimulates mitochondrial activity, improves glucose transport, and supports metabolic health.

This structured behavior, repeated across the week, is necessary for sustained physical and mental performance. Follow it without deviation.
