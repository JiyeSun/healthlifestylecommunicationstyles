This plan is designed based on biological mechanisms and behavior-outcome relationships:

- **Consistent meal timing** stabilizes insulin response and improves energy use across the day.
- **Protein- and fiber-rich breakfasts** reduce cortisol-driven hunger and blunt sugar spikes.
- **Balanced macronutrients at lunch and dinner** maintain satiety and prevent post-meal fatigue.
- **Avoiding late-night food** improves sleep quality and enhances fat oxidation during rest.
- **Daily movement**, even short bouts, stimulates mitochondrial activity, improves glucose transport, and supports metabolic health.

This structured behavior, repeated across the week, is necessary for sustained physical and mental performance. Follow it without deviation.

| **Lunch**    | Chicken wrap + side salad                | Lentil soup + whole grain toast          | Quinoa bowl with tofu + veggies          | Grilled fish + couscous + greens         | Hummus wrap + roasted veggies            | Rice bowl with beans + avocado           | Turkey sandwich + side salad            |
| **Dinner**   | Stir-fried veggies + brown rice          | Baked salmon + sweet potato + broccoli   | Chickpea curry + rice                    | Turkey chili + spinach                   | Baked tofu + quinoa + roasted carrots    | Veggie burger + kale salad              | Zucchini noodles + tomato sauce         |
| **Exercise** | 15-min walk after class or meals         | 20-min light yoga                        | 10-min morning stretches                 | 15-min walk or home workout              | 10 squats + 10 push-ups x2               | 20-min walk or dance session             | 10-min yoga wind-down                   |

This plan is designed with specific outcomes in mind:

- **Consistent meals** throughout the day help regulate blood sugar levels, improving energy and focus while preventing overeating at night.
- **High-fiber, high-protein breakfasts** (like oatmeal, yogurt, eggs) reduce cravings and improve metabolism throughout the day.
- **Balanced lunches and dinners** with lean protein, whole grains, and vegetables support digestion, muscle maintenance, and satiety.
- **Avoiding late-night heavy meals** helps the body rest and reduces fat accumulation during sleep.
- **Light daily physical activity**, even for just 10–20 minutes, boosts circulation, supports metabolism, and improves mood through neurotransmitter regulation.

These small, regular behaviors compound over time, supporting long-term weight management and emotional well-being.
Does this plan align with what you’re looking for? We can adjust any part of it together if you’d like."""
